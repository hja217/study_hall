How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It narrowed the lines to view down to just ones with differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Saves time on quick fixes and also sets you up to go back to an entire previous working version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You can update every time you have completed something that workspace
	Cons: You might lose some work, or forget to back up

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Typically when you're working in Google Docs, each document stands on its own.  
	In Git/programming, files may be inter-related and rely on each other to work.
	

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows you when things were changed, git diff shows you what is different
	between two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You know you can go back and recover the version that worked

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
